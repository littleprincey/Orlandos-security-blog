              I would never have thought that I would be happy to spend so much time on the internet, but the summer may as well not be happening in my world as I sit here joyously nerding out in the Cyber world. 
              I'm lucky enough to be with my family on holiday. There is no internet up here so every day I walk an hour in the beautiful hot sun to the local library for study.
