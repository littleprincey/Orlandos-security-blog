                I would never have thought that I would be happy to spend so much time on the internet, but the summer may as well not be happening in my world as I sit here joyously nerding out in the cyber world. 
                I'm lucky enough to be with my family on holiday. There is no internet up here so every day I walk an hour in the beautiful hot sun to the local library for study.

                Mani the Greyhound is happy to sleep all day next to me while I install virtual machines on my mac, setting up a pen testing lab for my Udemy course. Usually I would be three books down by this time but my avid reading has been relegated to the cool evenings, when I need to rest my eyes and enjoy a good story.

                 Since finishing Dev Academy last week, my body has made a quick recovery from the weeks of lazy chip dinners and survival mode. Mani and I are up early every day for a long walk before the sun hits (Greyhounds have pretty dismal body temperature regulation) and every day is filled with the most wonderous fruits and vegetables. I feel full with gratitude, wellbeing and energy. I wake up with the burning enthusiasm to learn, it really is a wonderful feeling. 
                 My girlfriend says i'm a nerd now.
